# Synthetic-Healthcare-Data-Analysis-with-SQL

This project was created as part of a technical challenge for the Python Developer Internship at NeuralBits Technologies.
It demonstrates the end-to-end process of generating a large-scale healthcare dataset using Python and performing advanced SQL queries for real-world insights.

Generated a synthetic dataset of 100,000+ patients using Python.
Simulated relationships across 5 interlinked tables: Hospital, Patient, Diagnosis, Treatment, Billing.
Wrote efficient SQL queries to perform time-based analysis, occupancy tracking, categorical grouping, and payment insights.
Designed with scalability and real-world use cases in mind.
